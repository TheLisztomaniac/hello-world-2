# hello-world-2
This is my first repository, trying to blend in with programming community!!


Well, guide says to write about myself so here goes,
this is my first time on github and I am a complete newbie with no prior experience in projects. It must be getting boring reading about some novice's first experience of something so I won't bore you with anymore crap. Good-bye.
